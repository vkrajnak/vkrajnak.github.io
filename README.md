### About

I am an interdisciplinary researcher interested in problems with no known solution. So far I have worked:
 - on applying dynamical systems theory to chemical reactions,
 - building generative models to predict tripeptide conformations,
 - speeding up and improving segmentation models using mathematics and statistics.

Should you be facing technical challenges that require a creative solution, please get in touch. I may not have the experience of working in your particular field of interest, but do not worry. Research is a never-ending learning process and it usually does not take long to get started.
